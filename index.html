        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The educational system in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and
          gurukulas.[1] This was similar to the former Indian system of
          education, in which the pupils would learn either in their homes or
          with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic
          country, the general public had no access to formal education. The
          first formal school, Durbar High School, established by Jung Bahadur
          Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese
          democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse
          population.[1] Education in Nepal from the primary school to the
          university level has been modeled from the very inception on the
          Indian system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.[2]
          Nepal 's 1971 education plan hastened its development in the
          country.[citation needed] In around1952/54 Nepal had 10,000 students
          in 300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent.[citation
          needed] There were 49,000 schools in 2010,[citation needed] and by
          2015 the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4
          percent and females 53.1 percent).[3] It has already been more than
          half-decade that public schools started imparting the education in the
          country.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Pre-Primary education for children of 3-5 years of age is currently
          not considered as a part of formal education system. Consequently,
          there are a limited number of Early Childhood Development (ECD)
          centers available for children in urban settings. According to the
          Department of Education, Sanothimi, Bhaktapur, the total number of ECD
          centers in the whole country was 23,659 as of 2008 whereas 639,031 as
          of 2018. Pre-schools and ECD centers which include Nursery, Lower
          Kindergarten and Upper Kindergarten are being skipped by the majority
          of children, thereby spending their time at home. However, for the
          future of Nepalese children, it is worthwhile to let them attend
          Pre-school as they can learn and develop their knowledge in
          preparation to attend Primary School.

          responsible for regulating the overall education system from
          curriculum development to school establishment in 7 provinces. There
          are various other regulatory bodies designated to oversee the
          education system at different levels including Secondary Education
          Examination (SEE) Board, that conducts and regulates the examination
          of grade 10. National Examination Board (NEB) regulates the conduction
